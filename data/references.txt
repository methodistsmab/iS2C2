The ligand-receptor interaction database of CCCExplorer includes 748 ligands, 630 receptors and 2671 ligand-receptor interactions. The sources of this ligand-receptor interaction database are Ligand Receptor Connectome (http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/suppl/Ramilowski_et_al_2015/, Ramilowski, Jordan A., et al. "A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signaling in human." Nature communications 6 (2015).) and our own unique, literature confirmed ligand-receptor pair database developed for this software (Choi, Hyejin, et al. "Transcriptome analysis of individual stromal cell populations identifies stroma-tumor crosstalk in mouse lung cancer model." Cell reports 10.7 (2015): 1187-1201.). Ligand Receptor Connectome (Ramilowski, Jordan A., et al. "A draft network of ligand-receptor-mediated multicellular signaling in human." Nature communications 6 (2015).) includes 642 ligands, 589 cognate receptors and 1,894 literature-supported interacting pairs (as of April 2015), while our own database (Choi, Hyejin, et al. "Transcriptome analysis of individual stromal cell populations identifies stroma-tumor crosstalk in mouse lung cancer model." Cell reports 10.7 (2015): 1187-1201.) contains 436 ligands, 325 receptors and 1,433 ligand-receptor interactions. We merged these two databases to generate a non-redundant set of 2,671 known interacting ligand-receptor pairs, in which 748 ligands and 630 receptors get involved.
